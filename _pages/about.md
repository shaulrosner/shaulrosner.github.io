I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Tel Aviv University, hosted by [Michal Feldman](https://www.mfeldman.sites.tau.ac.il/) and [Inbal Talgam Cohen](http://www.inbaltalgam.com/)

I recently completed my PhD at Reichman University, where I worked on my thesis titled "Models of Congestion with Non-Standard Utilities" under the supervision of [Tami Tamir](https://cs.runi.ac.il/~tami/). I worked on various models of congestion, primarily from an algorithmic game theory perspective.

My research focuses on algorithmic game theory, analyzing how strategic agents behave in congested systems and resource-limited environments. I am also exploring various directions in algorithmic contract theory.
