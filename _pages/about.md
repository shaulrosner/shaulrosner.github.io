I am a Postdoctoral researcher at Tel Aviv University, hosted by Michal Feldman and Inbal Talgam Cohen.

I recently completed my PhD at Reichman University, where I worked on my thesis titled "Models of Congestion with Non-Standard Utilities". I worked on various models of congestion, primarily from an algorithmic game theory perspective.
